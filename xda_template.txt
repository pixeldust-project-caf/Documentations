[ROM][device][10.0] PixelDust Android 10 for {device}

[B]PixelDust ROM[/B] is an Android 10 ROM especially built for Google Pixel and Nexus devices.

We rebased the project to Code Aurora Sources, more commonly known as CAF. CAF ROMs are therefore generally considered to be more optimized for Qualcommâ€™s Snapdragon SoCs than AOSP ROMs (in performance, RAM management, battery, etc.). We strive to keep the PixelDust Experience as close as possible to Android as Google intended. We add a decent selection of the coolest custom ROM features that would've been missed if they hadn't been included. 
The PixelDust Crew would highly appreciate if you would take a little of your time and leave your valuable feedback, your honest opinion or just say hello. If you should encounter a bug, or some kind of glitch that seems to be abnormal and you are pretty sure that it is related to the ROM (and not related to any special apps or mods you flashed on top), then please give as many details as possible.

Special shoutouts to [URL="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5545371"]Roger.T[/URL] for his amazingly designed wallpapers, logos and the best bootanimation I ever had on my Pixel!!!
